You decide taking jewelry from a statue is not a good idea.
(plus, red simply isn't your color.)
You stuff as much gold into your pockets as you can fit,
and begin to make your way back to the entrance,
calculating what you could fit into the caverns - 
maybe not a cart, but a wheelbarrow might fit....

Your feet sure do feel heavy. It must be from the strain of your quest.
The amulet statue seems oddly lifelike... you decide to pass around it as quickly as possible.
In fact, there are a lot of creepy statues in this room...
One stares at you accusingly, and you go to give it a rude hand gesture.
You stare in horror at your hand - your fingertips are turning to gold. 
You look back to the statue with the amulet, and notice her pockets are full of gold.
Just like you....

You immediately begin to dump gold out of your pockets, but it's too late.
You're rooted to the spot, staring desperately at the amulet. 
It's not gold, but the statue holding it has golden clothes. 
Everything the statues took with their cursed gold seems to have transformed into gold - 
except the amulet.

Your final thought is picturing dear Aunt Nan, laughing with her hoagie.
"Bit off a bit more than you could chew, didn't you, boy?"
Your eyes fill with golden tears.
