You enter a room so vast your eyes strain to see the far wall.
It's so full of gold and gems it hurts your eyes to look.
There's a light source, somewhere, because you're deep in a cave
and in order to see you need light....
We'll come back to that.
You scoop up as much gold as you can carry and exit the cave.
You buy yourself a golden house,
a golden horse
a golden sword.
You know, maybe gold isn't particularly useful for these things.
But boy does it look nice.

But in your golden house, you think
"Maybe I should go back, and get more."
You don't need it, of course
but isn't half the fun of adventuring the adventure?
