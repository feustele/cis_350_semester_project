You open a door at random.
Behind the door is another hallway, stretching off ad infinitum.
It makes you dizzy.
You close the door, but you realize-
there's no way out.
The entrance of the hall is gone. 
The exit of the hall is gone!
You have to go through the doors.
One door,
two doors, 
five doors...
one hundred doors...
Your skeleton is found clutching the doorknob to yet another door, 
no closer to the exit.
