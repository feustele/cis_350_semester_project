You decide you like the amulet and put it around your neck.
Suddenly, the gold seems to melt away,
draining like a bathtub down to the center of the room.
You stare as the statues seem to stand in living color, 
their golden clothes becoming normal wear again.

The woman you took the amulet from coughs horribly, 
falling onto her knees as the other statues do the same. 
One, an old man, calls, "HERO!"

You turn, and you recognize him.
It's the great wizard Ronald!
He's been missing since...

"YES!" he yells. "MY QUEST TO TRANSMUTE MATTER INTO GOLD
BROUGHT ME INTO THIS CAVE. I DARESAY IT WAS A SUCCESS!"
Every other person in the room groans loudly as Ronald preens.
"WISE HERO," (you think he means you, so you point at yourself.)
"YES YOU, YOU DOLT."
"THE GOLD I CREATED WAS CURSED. EVERY PERSON WHO TOUCHED IT WOULD BECOME GOLD.
SO I CREATED A FAILSAFE - THAT AMULET AROUND YOUR NECK. THE WEARER CAN TOUCH THE GOLD WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE."
A voice in the back of the room calls "But where did the gold go?"
"I WAS GETTING TO THAT!" Ronald booms.
"YES, SO WHERE WAS I? AMULET, YES. THE WEARER OF THE AMULET CAN ALSO DISSOLVE THE GOLD."
He seems to think that this is explanation enough,
but nobody else seems to agree.
"I need the bathroom!"
"I'm hungry!"
"It's been HOW long?"
Dozens of clamouring voices turn into a stampede for the exit. Thieves, assistants, brave knights, all 
dart towards the mouth of the cave, the woman who had held the amulet leading the charge.
Ronald pulls you close into an uncomfortable hug.
"DEAR HERO. YOU'VE SAVED US ALL!"
He pulls back, and looks at you piercingly.
"BUT YOU STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO..."
You wonder what he means as you leave, considering the amulet.
Maybe you'll go back to the cave, someday. 
The narrator seemed to think that there was more to the quest...
And so did Ronald, mighty wizard and eardrum burster extrordinare.
Well, that'll have to wait until we're done with the game.
