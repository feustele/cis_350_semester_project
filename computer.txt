You stare at the glimmering screen.
It's like nothing you've ever seen before...
You sit at the desk, enamoured with the screen.
You click a few buttons...
Then some more...
You have no idea what you're doing, of course,
but you've become so good at whatever it is you were doing that the zombie in charge (Clark, regional manager, hates his wife)
gives you a job.
All you have to do is click buttons...
forever...
and ever...
and...

END
