You catch a whiff of something... wonderful!
Lavender, or roses, or fleur-de-lis...
If you could bottle a field of flowers on a fresh spring day, you'd end up with something like this...
This room is full of scattered stalagmites and stalagtites made of crystal.
In the center of the room, a bubbling spring flows.
It gives off a faint glow.
Glowing water?
Sounds like a nice change of pace.
