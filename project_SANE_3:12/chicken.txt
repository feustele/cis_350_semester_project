...no?
No, you don't want to enter the cave?
What?
Why did you even - 

Look, we worked really hard on this game.
Why would you open it without even playing it?

I can't believe - you know what,
here. Here's your stupid achievement.

You go back to your village as a laughingstock,
you went looking for gold and glory only to fall at the first hurdle. 
even Aunt Nan thinks you've lost it.
You live in a crappy old house for the rest of your days,
dreaming of what could have been, had you not been
such a cheap, corruptable coward.
