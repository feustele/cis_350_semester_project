You've entered a cavern.
It's so large and dark - you'd better watch your step.

In fact, because we haven't programmed the "look" feature yet,
I'll just tell you. 
There's a great big pit in the middle of this room.
If you walk around it, you'll be safe.
If you fall into the pit, you'll die.

... of what?
Snakes, probably. Or stalagmites. 
Or maybe there's no bottom, and you'll just keep falling forever
(or until the game crashes.)

What do you do?
