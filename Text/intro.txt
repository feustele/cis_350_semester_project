This is the story of a hero.
Most stories are, of course,
but you can play this one.
Dear hero, you are going to embark upon a quest so elaborate and in depth,
so treacherous and dastardly, that you won't know up from down,
right from wrong,
and your chainmail from your Chimera
(once we finish the game, of course.)

Welcome to Project SANE!

Now, dear hero;
you are faced with the entrance to a cave.
You have heard legends of what is found within this cave;
treasures, some claim
monsters, say others
a really good hoagie, says your beloved Aunt Nan
(bless her)
You are armed with nothing but the clothes on your back.
Perhaps that was ill advised.
